Crazy to be. Bits of B. So what did you say again to being more, being discipled, make, what was the, what? You become more human. I love that. It's not permanent is it? It's not. Oh, come off. People have used stuff. Yeah, a bit of WT4, yeah. Come on. Yeah. So yeah, interesting, huh? Okay. #um. And and. Yeah, and part of the idea the reason why I don't know. So these these. These are some of the things that I've got to read for all my stuff again. Well, that's where I was gonna go next. Yeah. Is how do we? how do we go next? So this is kind of what I do. is taking ideas like this and then getting it into production. Yeah. So, The methodology for getting something like this, where you've got a huge volume of ideas, and you've curated that over time. Curation is the right word. And getting that into something where we've got something tangible that's working, is we need to take an iterative approach. So the idea being is that we, we don't plan everything out. Okay? And then go, right, we've spent 6 months planning this. Let's now do it, and then in 2 years time we'll have something, because the problem with that is that you'll get to the end and inevitably, there'll be lots of changes, because it's not right, and it ends up taking forever and you never get it done. The bottom line is you never get it done. So the iterative approach is where you say, okay, well, what's the most important factor in this? Especially where we are now with technology, change is quite cheap. Okay. So, so the idea being, and when I say cheap, I don't mean necessarily just money, I mean time and, you know, the effort and the complexity and all of that, the cognitive load on change. is quite cheap now. So you can you can go down the path and you can get something up and running and you can look at it, get hands on it, and you can go, yeah, no. And if it's no, actually, and it's proven now, it's better to get it wrong like that and do a few iterations and then get something where you go, oh, yeah, that's right. And then you build on that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my style, anyway. Exactly. And it works really really well doing that. So what we can do, because you've got so much information, I've got a lot of thoughts, is we can take all of that and we can put it into AI. Okay, and we can say, um, so there's a couple of things here. Um, The one thing, and it's most probably better that you create it. is, and let's do it now, actually, because you're on the internet. So let's go, this is all free. So if you just get on the internet and go to Jira, just Google the word Jira, GIRA, it's a project management system. Project management. Yeah. Don't worry about it. It's just task. It just glorified task twists. Okay. But what this allows us to do is there's 2 or 3 things we need to start realising this, right? Um, um, one is a project management system. It's just a glorified task list. 2 is somewhere where we keep the code that'll be GitHub. #um and three is the way we control it all and we put it through and that's AI. So, get on the internet and Google Jira. How'd you say a spell? G J I R A. I. They go, go to, yeah, go to the result. Yeah, top result okay and then #um. Just accept your cookies. And then, if you got Google account, so just click on Google there don't don't pick me around and just click on Google. And sign in with your if that's the right one or use another account, whichever one you you would log in with with Google. I can't remember my password, so is is always the one. Quite impressive, did you impress yourself? I I've really have. That's what I was thinking like. Okay. Not gonna happen like. Yeah. Yes, it makes me. Okay, good enough, you just write that down. What is it? Is it something? If it works, yeah. I very rarely have paper, some of them. Oh, I tell you what I have got. Yeah, I've got paper, don't I? I take what I'm bringing. Yeah, I haven't got paper, but I did, but I can't believe, honestly, I can't believe I've got that right, just like that. Would you? #oh the gods. There's a snow case beef. God best. Wow. So click can continue? #oh #Ah, no no no no sorry MOM continue click back. There was a a different continued. Clive close that. That's not good. Go again, you have to start again. Should go to Jira JI, yeah, that's it. Not that one, not that one scroll down they'll be there that one yeah. And then click on Google. #, yeah. And then #Ah, you have to DO it again. I'm afraid. I know this time. Do you find thing again? #, oh no, this time so not that one this one continue down here. That's it. So the press council. Yeah, suppose so, yeah. So what's this full name Darren James yet continue? Great, it's gonna give you a nice blank fight your site. What do you want? What do you want to call this thing? Or the moments of discipleship tracker, but. See track. What what what do you mean? Yeah, so this is gonna create a website for you. Where we can, where we can plan everything out. So um, it's the name of the website. It doesn't have to be associated to the project, but it does help if it is. So you can call it Darren's Tracker if you want. No, we call it discipleship cracker. Yeah. That's what it, that's what I want to do with it. All lower case, no spaces. So it's a website address. So Capsop doesn't matter. Just side pool. Decipher ship. Or one murder. Yeah. Continue. On the right spin of my website. Yeah, good. Yeah, you can't change it actually. I think you can, but anyway. He's doing a lot of heavy lifting in the background there. Yeah, it's done lots of stuff in the background. #um but basically what this does. Is this a free service? Yeah, it's great, isn't it? So if you just put in software development at top left, just click that top left. So that's what we're gonna write create #um. What do we want to do? We want. We just want to #ah manage tasks that's all we want to DO. We want to. Don't want to do anything flash. glorified task list. So then put your space name, so call it Tracker. Now this is not dependent on it. So you just call it. Oh, it's, oh, look, it's. lowcase again? You can, no, you can do this with case and everything. So just call it track and that's fine #ah my software team that's fine and then get started. Good, and then #Ah story top, yeah that's fine. #ah next. #Ah, how DO you track your work to DO in progress in? Have you done yet? That's fine. Finish. Yeah. Yeah. #um and then hopefully it'll set it up for you. Then go, it'll give you a little project board in a minute. A lot hard work, yeah, so free. Pre pretty good. Governments use this and everything it's really good. So don't worry about #um ALL of this #ah now if you can go. #um and invite me, if you could invite me to see you on there, just trying to remember where it all is. Add people and then if you could just put in my email address there. If it's Christian. Tom, yes. Well, what password info? Like it's from Google. Because you click on game. Okay, so it uses your Google password. Okay, which I do then. Which you know now. So it's great. Good. Okay, so that's added me to your project. And so don't worry about anything else for now, and just click okay. You can close it or bookmark it might be a good thing. So that you know where it is for future. How do you bookmark? #Ah, just in your browsing, you know like #um #ah. Actually, this is a map because this is a church computer anyway. Fine, just close it then let's good. So I can log on to this anywhere, can I? Yeah, you can, yeah. You just use your Google account, right? Just a Google account. Yeah, um, and I've got an invite, so to decide... So I'll bookmark it because it will make it easier. So don't mark this tab, yeah. Yep, that star. Tracker, just click down. Yeah, yeah, great. Okay, so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take your, your script from Gemini. I'm gonna take the notes from here my notes from here. Yep. And I'm gonna put it all in AI. Yeah, and I'm gonna ask it to produce a summary and also ask it to produce um a phased list of tasks. So I'm going to say produce phase one, phase two, phase three, however many phases it thinks it needs. And I'm going to say, right, what should we do phase one to get something up and running? And I'll put it all in here, I'll get AI to put it all in here, do that for us. Um. And then what we can do is we can meet up. Yeah. And we can go through this and we can say does that look about right? Okay. And if it looks about right, then we'll we'll create something. Yeah. And then we'll see what it looks like. Sorry, what do you mean by create something? We'll create the solution. We'll create the tracker. Wow, well, create the first version of the tracker. Take it would. It won't take long at all. This is the beauty of AI now you see we can create things really quickly. And so, like I haven't got on top on me. I am just trying to think if I can. I can't, I mean, I mean, how do we? How do you? So I might be, I the reason why I'm blown away. Is because in in my head, I thought. This is gonna be. I think I've even got it in there that this is way above my pay grade in that I know these people who've got better theology than me. And people who's got better software skills than me. Yeah, I don't know got got if God blesses it then it'll be good on. Yeah, so I, yeah, but so I thought. I thought I would need to. One of the ways that the tracker will work. Is that? In the background, it's got. Good theology, yeah so that. If people go outside it, It. Yeah, there's a lot of things that I've got into this. We've got this beautiful woman not gonna mention a name, but got this beautiful woman who's. Who? Like she's got all the fire and passion that you want in the Christian. But sometimes she just goes off on these. Tangents, #uh-huh. #, oh well, and I know what there's there's two tangents she goes off on one is and both of these are rude and that she loves Jesus. But what are the tanges is because she comes from a Muslim background? Right. And. She she's looking for the Christian equivalent of the. You do this this time of day and that time of day. Oh and it's not like that. It's not like that. No, so she's looking for the like the prayer time equivalent. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. So she's always on the internet looking for... doesn't exist. Yeah. Well, it does exist, but she shall find some wacko. Who's doing it? He's like, no, don't go down that road. Okay. So you want the app to be able to pull people back away from that kind of stuff? Yeah. Yeah, not because you never put take that not because you could put every iteration of every. No we can do that. Yeah, but no, so no, so we can, we can do that. So... Um, In that fact, there's some software libraries now, AI, software libraries that have just matured enough, That would make that possible. Okay. So what we can do is we can start to document In a very rigid form. What that looks like. Okay, yeah. And then, then what we can do is we can. Get people to. Even voice note their day or where they are. into AI do do speech to text and then use AI to compare it against our rigid view. And then we, and then we can get get it and then we can. Play around with what that looks like in terms of the output back to the user. Pretty insane, isn't it? It is insane. And we can do that really quickly. I could get that up and running in a couple of hours. Yeah. Like literally a couple of hours I could have something like that. Yeah, because I don't know what the possibilities are. With AI, it's like, I mean, I've got a 2018 quid Claude subscription. And I'm, I'm now it, uh, it gives you an X amount of usage every day, right? So Claude is just one of these chat GPT things. Okay. And I've plugged it into my code and I mean, so Claude's best for coding. And I'm using all of my subscription every day now. Um. And I'm motoring through stuff. I'm creating so much code at the moment. Wow. And I'm really excited by it. I feel like I feel like an 18 year old software engineer again. Great. I'm loving it. And so, um, all of these things are very, very possible, and the fact, I've literally been down praying to get to a position where I can do this stuff with my skill set, for, for 8 years, ever since I've come to Christ, I've been praying into this. Wow. And I'm literally, your Hannah and I have been financially working towards making it possible that I can put my time into doing this stuff. And it feels like this year is the year it's gonna happen. Wow. And so we're, we're, um, right in the process of renting out, um, uh, our spare room, right, um, to the colleges, that's gonna bring into money. I'm trained. I'm teaching evening classes, AI at the moment. Well, I've rented the Methodist Hall online walk. So I'm doing it myself. Oh. And I started on Tuesday, actually. I've got 6 people booked in face to face training. Four week course. So that's working. So it's wiping its face at the moment, but if I can get a few more bookings into February and March, then it will start earning me money as well. And with these things, I'm hoping that within, and a bit of contracting work, I'm hoping I'll be able to quit my job. Okay. With a view that I'll be spending all my daytime doing this kind of stuff. That's what I want to do. It's what I've been trying to work towards. So if you know anybody who's got a little bit of normal software work that they want doing, so I can quit my job and focus on this. That's what I'm looking for. Like one or 2 days a week. where I can just earn enough money to pay the bills and then I'll put almost on the software side that I'm looking out for. Oh, whatever somebody wants. I mean, like normal software development like web websites that kind of stuff. Oh, okay. Do you know what I mean? Like normal software. People, you know, companies that are paying for software, they need somebody. I'm highly skilled, like, when I was contracting, I was charging nearly £1000 a day. Yeah. So, you know, I'm not, I'm not your, I'm not your playground kitty contractor. And I can achieve a lot. I've been coding professionally for 30 years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, I know what I'm doing. Yeah, that's where I am. I'm dead set, dead keen. I can get this stuff running. So next steps, you've invited me to that. I'll take everything you've given me and I'll put it through AI and get it to summarise and then effectively will phase it all out into here. Okay. And that will do all that for us. And then we can come back and we can look at it. Um, When do you want to do that? Come back and look at it.
