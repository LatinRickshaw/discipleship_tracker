Just one man, Abraham, and then his family. And these 2 parts are connected by a hinge story at the beginning of chapter 12. And this design gives a clue to how to understand the message of the book as a whole. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Right. So, um, but I've heard. I've heard the main guy on there separately in terms of what. He talks about in terms of. Creation and the purpose. Uh-huh. Things like that and. And then. A lot, which is I I appreciate I did give you nowhere near enough time to to look at the stuff. I should have said it too soon. That's right. But along with your classic like CS Lewis. Yes. Um, Then there's somebody else that I've got. in the right app, she. Um, I forgot her name now, but there's somebody who's got like a definition of sin where she's coming to it from a from a kind of different from a different angle. Uh huh. Um... But then, going back to the reason why I'm going from, like, an artistic point of view as well. So so there's words that there's words that are going to mention, but don't think that I've necessarily got a big grasp on them. But be. Because. I'm thinking about. God and that God is. Has has created certain patterns and not just patterns for living, but there's patterns in creation. And so that we are, We, we are a fractal of God's creation where, I get that. And and so. These are sort of things that I'm I'm going for that if we. If we are a fractal, instead of looking at discipleship as somebody who we as a way of someone being sculpted when God said, when Jesus says, go and make disciples, it's not make as in sculpt, but more like, Tending a garden, growing a garden. It's much more frat, frat. More like nurture. Nurture. And and so I want the. I've I've looked a lot of that is in the in the stuff where you read it, but it's nice to have the conversation. So what I've looked at either my, my background where like, like, the Pentecostal side, which, which. Um, I'm not saying it's all like that. I'm just looking at my experience and speak with it. The monastery, I came to faith in the Pentecostal. Yeah, but it was my experience of sort of like when you've got the sort of when the sort of. Pentecostal. With a kind of. Stripped Caribbean. Layer on it. When I looked at that, then I also looked at sort of like. Catholic catechism. Yes. It's very rule based when it's. When discipleship becomes legalism. It's a very different thing. It's no longer discipleship. And so it's like, how do you have a tracker? How do you develop a tracker, which is much more about nurturing? So that the morality happens because of the byproduct of, of how did you, you just been in the presence of God? Yeah. Rather than just being there. Upside down. So it's not the morality 1st then the presence afterwards. It's the Being in the presence of God. And that delivers morality. Yeah, of course. I mean, it's like, I'm sure you know in your own walker, my walk. That as you seek Christ, you become naturally more moralistic anyway. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And it's also just, again, like, just be even being a parent. You don't have children. So that you could. Be moralistic with them or teach the morals. Obviously, you teach the morals, but you hope that comes because. That's not your that's not what you said out to do. No, no, you want them to be present with you. You want to be present with them and then there's just things where you're back to that word you just used. Through the process of nurturing, those other things happen, but you don't say, #, oh let's start a family so we could. You know, that just, it just, you know, and so I really want the app as much as possible to say like, okay, what? What would be the highest? What would be the highest ideal to start with the app? Okay, the highest ideal has to be God. And if God is the highest ideal, how did we come into? How did we come into being? Well, we came into being because God is love. Yes. And God is a community of love and love is love is life, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And he said, let us make man in our own image. that's right. And so let us make man in an image of love because that's who God is. And so if, if the tracker could start from. That basis and and the and the tracker is a a fractal of the way God does stuff that's how I want it. That makes sense. That's how I want it to be. And that's all very subjective. It is subjective, which I've got in my real like how do you have these? Subjective things. But but you need objectives to measure. Measure. What you can. Well, it's you're then looking at the quantitative and the qualitative, right? So, um, with the with the subjective, you're you're looking at the qualitative stuff. Yeah. Um, So the, it's interesting. Some in my industries, a couple of very clever people did a survey back in 2016, um, called the State of Devots. Anyway, it was a survey of all of the software engineers across Silicon Valley. So it was kind of like, you know, it was 1000s and 1000s of people that they did their tests on. They were given access to all of these engineers and they worked because what they wanted to understand was what made a good engineer. And and so, you know, it's a very subjective thing. Yes. So very similar, different lens. Yep, but very similar. And what they came up with was a concept of what's called an employee net promoter school. So net promoter score is an algorithm that it's quite simple, but it's an algorithm that. Determines the score of your company from your customer's perspective. Oh. Okay, now, and that's MPS. Employing that promoter score, ENPS, was taking that to your employees and using the same thing. Would you work for this company? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And and um, I use it in my career now. So I measure the people that report to me, so all the engineers, I'd measure them using ENPS and it is amazing. And it's subjective, but it's also objective. Yeah, okay. So, so, and it works. works really, really well. So we could look at something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a, I love this. Oh, I love this, because this is this, this is why intuitively. Well, intuitively and obviously I've been, I scam things and read things. Yeah, which is, you know, you've got the You've got like. The hard-core like apologetics. Yeah, yeah. And then you've also. We're human, aren't we? So we've got all of the all of the facets of humanity in in discipleship as well. Well, yeah. But you've got the hardcore apologetics, but then you've also got Um, We're living in an age now where it's a thing type of word for Christian. There's a thing where, but how do you, how do you? A world that has become so rational. How do you how do you reenchant the world and that and that I forgot the 3rd one but. Two of the aspects of God is beauty and truth. So how do you present to people beauty, And truth? In in a way that is not about facts and fiction. It's about spirit and. And subjecting that. And subjectiveness. The art, the fractal. Yeah. And so I, I, I have this strong, strong, strong, strong feeling, intuition that this needs to be. To. To see God as the artist, if you look at all of creation, if you look at the universe, there's. This imagination, which is subjective, but is very objective because. Everything is just so well measured and so well put together. Uh, you know, I'm... I love it. I and yeah, I'm just, I've got a race of thoughts going around in my head. Yeah, and so how do you how do you give people, you know, I'm not. I'm not. So the one thing that I read on your Gemini thread? And I'd like to challenge in a good way. Yeah. Um, because I'm not sure, I'm not sure it's biblical. #um and also, I came across the same question when I started looking at. So my, my, my concept originally sort of 8 years ago now, 9 years ago was, was it was a self-help app? Yeah. So a Christ lens, self-help, Christworld view, self-help app. You know, because I wanted to measure myself. I wanted to understand where I was going and was I good when I had a bad day? Why was it bad? How can I get better on these things? And the one thing that I did read in your message was in your chat with Gemini was that you wanted to set a bar. #um that you wanted to I could pull it off because I' VE got Wi-Fi now but #um here we go. I must be reminded of what? Yeah, so. Here we go. Um. Online feature that would record people's progress with some type of metro that could be put alongside the ideal. So the ideal to see where the gaps in asking the question, right? And then I haven't. I didn't read much more. Oh man, there's loads. Wow. Okay, fine. I didn't realise it went that far because I was literally just reading it. But and I don't know whether you've gone beyond that yet. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Maybe you've gone way beyond that. So, so I think I would say it's a work in progress. I'll say it's much more an imagination of progress. Yeah right. Yeah. Well, that's wonderful. I didn't realise there was so much. What I'd like to do. And because a long list chat like that is is well it's just a long list of chat, right? Yeah, yeah. Is that the only source of documentation you've got so far? Is that is that your kind of master document? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, it's my master document with... And ideas. Wisdom, whatever. No, with various master documents. I'd get to a certain stage and I would say, right, could you? Could you put all of that together and what would that be like if it was a proposal for this? Yeah. Or preserve it, what am I trying to say when I say that? Yeah, yeah, of course. So it's got files within files if that would if that's the thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, absolutely. But the ideal. So I think I think we can close over that because I think it's most probably way beyond that anyway. Yeah. That was literally, it's one at the top. But actually, I'll be surprised if it's not in there, but actually it was it's. It's actually in there, though I think there's a critique of the self help. Because it, it, you know, it. My the answer I came up with to the same question was. Well, actually, you should only compare against yourself or God. Yes. And so to compare against God is a tricky thing. Yeah. Because you'll never reach that standard. And so therefore I thought, well, actually then what you need to do is is track your progress. Yeah. And and create your own baseline. And, you know, so so the idea would be the idea concept I came up with was that you would start using the app and you wouldn't get any results for for like 2 weeks. Yeah. Because it needs to learn who you are and then you create your baseline and then it works from that. Oh, well, interesting. I've actually made it more. I've purposely made it more difficult than that. Because one, I don't want it to be divorced from the church. Yep. If you wanna do something separate. Fine, but there's more than enough tools out there for you to do something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, self- self- self. So it's it's. Yeah, yeah. So let me just put this out there just so that we don't need to. So knowing that it's something that could be. Abused or that somebody could be abused through it. Yes. There are some stuff there already that I've already talked about. Good, gotcha. All right. So... Knowing that I've already thought about that, put that to one side. Gotcha. So the idea is that. The app is that you do that it's about it's about discipleship and so it's got to be done one on one. Okay, so it's about one on one. It's about one on one, but then it's also about. It's about one on one, but then it's also so you know what you said about your giving it to churches. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's about given the tracker to churches, churches, churches could use at all. Where? So they use it to like in Sunday school or whatever, but no, you like less like if you more mature Christie than me, you would meet me at Costa. Right. Yeah, and we go through the tracker and talk about things or whatever. But part of the tracker is fellowship is just part of discipleship is fellowship. You can't, completely agree. Yeah. So part of the tracker is the fact that I'm meeting up with somebody. And so can you just go through a scenario of what that might look like? So you've mentioned that you've you meet up at a, at a, at a, 2 people meet up at a coffee shop. Inevitably, one of those people, you know, is more mature as a Christian. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So there's work that I've done by myself with the tracker. Yeah, yeah. But then... Let's just say I've I'm not put a a a thing on this, but let's just say eight tenths of the work I've done wherever by myself at home, whatever. But then I meet up with you and we're having a chat, we're having a coffee or whatever. And because because I've met with you, that's part of the criterion that we talk through stuff. Yeah. That fulfils a part of the track because fellowship is part of that. I understand. Yeah. So it's not that, it's not that, so if I'm the user of the tracker, and I meet with you and we have a coffee, it's not that you know that I'm using the tracker app. It's that I know I'm using the tracker app and then I can tick that box. Is that what you mean? That's not what I mean. I'm not saying it couldn't be that, but it's it's. Because I'm trying to create something where about the commandment, go out there and make disciples. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm acknowledging that I'm a disciple and that I'm being discipled by someone. So there's a slice of this pie where you're interacting with, with the tracker with me. #um. So could you talk me through the role, the role, the roleplay, the scenario, the roleplay of what would happen and how the app is involved in that? #um because I' M missing that bit. Don't understand that bit I don't think. How would it work? Like you and so you and me meet up for a coffee? Like, do it without the app. So, you and me meet up for a coffee, right? Yeah. And we're meeting up as Christian brothers. And, you know, I share some of the challenges. I've got, you share some of the challenges. We shared the gospel, we fix our eyes on Christ and we grow a little bit in our fellowship and in our faith, and then we go on our merry way again. Now, where does the app come into? Where does the track wrap come into that? Are you both users? Is one of you a user and one is not? No, no, no. Where both users, but. But if if. If you're by mentor or if you're my mentor or or discipler. However it is, yeah. However it is, yeah. Um, It. In terms of the app, that would only go in one direction because you. In some other area of your life would have somebody who's looking out for you. Yeah, that's fine. So if you're using the app, Um. For want of a better term, you're answerable to somebody else if you're not answering 100% yeah. Not answerable to me. Okay, fine. But how would that surface in the app in the use of the app? How would, how do you envisage the, the, the, the app would, so that scenario that I gave you where you meet his disciples, one of you is more mature. You share your, you share your challenges in life, you deciple the discipleship takes place. And then there'll be challenging that. And so so you would... How would the app be used in that? You would lock that challenge. You would love what, what? And who would log it? The discipler or the disciple? The disciple. So the person being decided? Yeah, you just log that and then it'll give you For a better goals, goals for the week, gotcha. Goals for the month, whatever, but you'd be able to. To look at that and that that that in there, I think I I think I I think I call those the crucible moments. Okay. Where you, where you're going through certain things. But then I've also got, In there, as you said, there's lots to read. Do you know #um? #um. Let me see if I can remember the word early because it intrigued me that GS yoda GO theodolite. A geo theodolite is a is a is a piece of equipment. That. This is how I learned about it because it's a channel tunnel when they're when they'll have the digging machine to make the channel tunnel. You, you can't use satin for anything. Of course you're underground. Yeah. So you use this geo geo theodolite, which works on the magnet. Fine. Okay. Yeah. And so I've got... 3 criteria that I can't remember what they are, but 3 criteria that they're geo theodolite would measure, and I've, and I, and I, I call that like the working in the dark. that these are things that you do in secret, that you're doing in private, that you're doing one to one. that, yeah, that, yeah, cartoon, yeah. But if you do this tracker thing, the whole idea is where I got the idea from is that when you're coming from the French side and you're coming from the English side, that. That at some point these two tunnels coming from different directions need to hit. If one of them is even slightly out, it's fine if it's slightly out day one and slightly out day two. But if it's slightly out day 30, You're over there. You're over there. So it's the tracker, the idea of it is to have. Really good theology and what discipleship and your purposes on one end. Tracking what you're doing on this end and meeting in the middle. And it's always just, it's just on a week to week basis, it's day-to-day basis, but when you'll meet up with somebody weekly, it's always just adjusted, you say, you should be a, you should be a better disciple. Well, it's almost like the vision I have of that. It's like the Stairway Tavern, right? You know, so each step that you achieve, each element of your maturity in Christ, you go up a step. And then the next step up has got different different criteria. Yeah, but you're, but, but you're recognising that this is a lifelong, you know. Of course, it's the journey, right? journey, yeah. We know the destination. but it's the journey. Yeah. And so that's the whole idea, that the, that, And that because it's not because it's. Because discipleship. Is part of. #um. Either one to one or small group and part of a larger church. It's... Well, it's always so many things, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it is so many things, but I'm limiting to a few things. In that. Very wise. There shouldn't be, you know, there shouldn't be I'll be like, to be honest, I wouldn't be against that because it wouldn't be harmful. But. But there shouldn't be anybody saying really. Oh, it's possible to be a Christian. You don't need to go to church. It's possible to be into Christian. You could just pray at home and do that by... I mean, you might get somewhere, but you wouldn't get half as far as if you've got one-to-one discipleship, small groups, church, and everything else. In saying that, even if you don't get anywhere, I'm saying that. That the model of the church and the model of discipleship is based on God's very nature. That's right. And so, The tracker would take that into consideration that, The reason why we're doing it in this way is because it's, God has created us to be in fellowship. Well, I've got so I've got some images coming into my head. I don't know what they mean but. Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and so. Yeah, and so the whole idea the whole idea and then one of the ideas is like if you've got #um. People who. Have never been join a pen. If you've got people who've never been, um, who've never discipled before, which I've got loads of people. Yeah, I've got loads of those people that I've never discipled before. What's this? Thank you. Oh, I've got those those people that I've never discipled before. That the very process of using the tracker, Meeting up with people means a year down the road. Not only have they experienced a user at all. But it's easy for them now to go and disciple other people because it's being modelled. So you've got the user over here. Don't want this is this is what I had in my head. Okay. And it's kind of like. Oh, it's not super washable, is it? That's all right. So, we've got... See, have you got a bit of water? Oh, don't worry, actually, Dan. It's fine. Oh, come on. come on. They will come on. God. What's this one? So the idea I had was kind of like this. Anyway, so the kind of... under I had was... It's kind of. This being like your ethics and your morals. Yeah. And and this. Being yeah objectives. So this being your objective and this being your subjective. And you know this having lots of things coming off of it, but you know that represent that. And this having the same, lots of things coming off a bit. And, you know, you are basically achieving this and achieving this and achieving this, which I mean, I don't know why that vision came. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not spice. It's weird, isn't it? But um, but the whole thing. Yeah. Being being what? Being the baseline that you talk about. Yeah, yeah. And the baseline, No, probably not the base. Yeah, it's the base. Or the, the target. Whatever you want to call it. Yeah, the target is that That. By being discipled. You become more human. I like that.
