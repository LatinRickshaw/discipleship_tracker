Oh, sorry, it's gonna be closer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he was explaining to me that, that. You've got AI and it. #um and put these into my own words now. But you've got AI and it's just got all of its arms out and it's just pulling in information. But. Some of that information is good and you don't know what information is bad, but it uses all the information that's out there. Okay. And then he was explaining that. With this app, with not app. I'm using that your user tab with with this with this tracker. Yes. You said, I almost want an, and I'm sure you used the word a something agent. Yeah. Where, where. Where the AI isn't influenced by all the stuff out there, you're actually finding the stuff that you want to train it on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's a thing called rag server. Um, which is um, retrieval augmentation generation. And there's also MCPs. So these are the big buzzwords that are going around at the moment. rag services where you use your data with AI to drive whatever it is you're trying to achieve. So instead of using the internet data, you use your data. So that's rag. And then MCP is where you use AI to control other services. So if you wanted to integrate into Google Drive or something like that, then you would use an MCP service. Okay. So rag is what connects you to your own data. MTP is what allows you to control integrated services. Okay. And it's all AI centric. Yeah. Well, I suppose, because what I was speaking to about was that. My. My idea of the tracker is, is as much. Influenced by. Theology. Yes. As it is also #um. Art. So the idea that. That what I'm thinking about discipleship. I'm not thinking about so I'm not coming from it. Morally. Even though. Morality is. Downstream from that and is involved into typership, obviously. Yeah. But it's, it's, I was much looking at. #um the the who are the different people the guy #um Tom Wright NT Wright. #um because of his theology on. Discipleship and new creation of what we've, a lot of the stuff that you talked about is much more objective, like we've been created for something. It's not just, it's not just woolly and we're not just waiting to die and go to heaven. That's right. So we have a purpose here. We have a purpose here. Yeah. And so it... And and and and so there there's something there that's measurable and I forgot the name of the guy, but the guy who. Is one of the lead theologians, narrators, and writers of the Bible project, those animations that come upon. I'm terrible with names. Yeah, yeah, but do you know the Bible project? It's on YouTube. It's got like 100s of animations of like... Yeah, it's just, can I have a look? Yeah, it's got 100s of animations on. Yeah, it's it's they're just brilliant. But, um, They found a way of communicating the Bible in these kind of 10 minute. Teaching sessions. Okay. And they've got. I'm wondering whether these, it's possibly some of the videos we've used at youth or what they've actually used in Sunday services at HBC. They usually have an American accent. Yes. Yeah. Come on, why are you not connected now? You are now. Okay, fine. Come on then. So there'll be a whole project. That's them, yeah. Which one? #oh it's this one, yeah. #, oh no, what are you doing now? Why are you going there? If you pause that, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just press.
